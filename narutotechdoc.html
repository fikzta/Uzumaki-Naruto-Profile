            <p>Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū, literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).</p>

            <p>
                Naruto is noted as boisterous, exuberant, and unorthodox, quite similar to Hashirama Senju. He inherited his mother's verbal tic, as he ends his sentences with "Dattebayo!" (だってばよ!) when emotional. Though he responds best to competition and is not afraid to ask for assistance, Naruto is relatively naïve and slow to understand principles or situations. He often requires an oversimplified analogy in order to grasp explanations and can even prove forgetful.[26] Naruto is aware of his faults and admits he acts strong to mask his embarrassment and frustration about them. Despite his naivety, Naruto can be quite observant, picking up on things others miss and retaining information casually gathered through conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up as an orphan who suffered years of hatred and social isolation has influenced Naruto's character in a number of ways: he is heedless to formality and social standings, addressing certain people with nicknames instead of honourifics, although by the time of his adulthood, Naruto has slightly outgrown this trait. He has picky eating habits of ramen, his favourite food; he has a perverted side that manifests as attempts to peep into women's baths, although these moments are rare. Despite his quirks and the criticism they earn him, Naruto is said to have a personality that draws people to him, inspiring friendship and loyalty through acts of genuine kindness that could change a person's world view and thus built meaningful relationships that he lacked in early life; the Sage of Six Paths believes Naruto's kindness is a special gift that allows him to save Kurama from its hatred. Naruto deeply cherishes these bonds and will go to great lengths to protect them, best seen with Sasuke after his defection from Konoha. Naruto's time at the Falls of Truth revealed that a part of him hated the villagers for ostracising him, only to admire him after he saved them during Pain's Assault. Upon confronting it, he learned to be at peace with it, willingly becoming greater than what he suffered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another of Naruto's prominent traits is his desire for acknowledgement; his pranks around the village were for people to notice him, even if it meant by scolding him. Therefore, he dreamed of one day becoming Konoha's Hokage, the epitome of acknowledgement and respect from everyone in the village. Knowing his dream is a long, arduous and seemingly impossible path, Naruto developed his own nindō of never going back on his word. This life-long philosophy serves as the cornerstone of Naruto's great self-confidence; he believes he can accomplish any goal with enough hard work and perseverance, no matter what. This trait guides him in many aspects of life, such as his promise to bring Sasuke back to Konoha. Over time, his goal to be Hokage grew from a desire for the acknowledgement of others to a desire to help and protect the people close to him, which Tobi attributed to the Will of Fire. His nindō has since been reinforced by his understanding that shinobi were meant to endure through hardships. His belief in hard work and perseverance made him detest shortcuts to achieving, as he disqualified his son from the Chūnin Exams for using the banned Kote, and expressed disgust at Momoshiki and Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki for their reliance on harvesting from Chakra Fruits to lazily gain power.

            <header>Appearance</header>
            <p>According to Jiraiya, Naruto strongly resembles his father: he has yellow-blond, spiky hair and blue eyes, while inheriting the shape of his mother's eyes and face. His trademark characteristics are the three whisker markings on his cheeks. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Dan Katō initially mistook Naruto for Nawaki due to their stark resemblance. Naruto was rather short for his age during Part I, though he grew to be taller than Sakura in Part II. Naruto originally wore green goggles on his forehead, though he discards them upon becoming a genin.</p>
            <p>In Part I, Naruto wore an orange and blue jacket with a white collar, a white swirl with a tassel on the left side, and a red Uzumaki crest on the back. He also wore orange pants with a shuriken holster on his right knee, blue sandals, and a blue forehead protector, given to him by Iruka after graduating from the Academy. In Part II, Naruto wears a more form fitting outfit after wearing out his original one while training with Jiraiya, with a T-shirt or mesh armour underneath. While retaining the swirls and orange pants, the blue pieces of his outfit changes to black: his forehead protector (which is now longer), sandals, and orange jacket, the black colour showing more prominence than the blue did originally. During his battle with Pain, Naruto briefly wore a short-sleeved red coat with a black flame pattern around the hem and carried a large scroll on his back.</p>
            <p>Naruto loses his right arm after the Fourth Shinobi World War, though it is later replaced by a fully maneouverable prosthetic arm made of Hashirama Senju's cells, wrapped completely in bandages. In The Last: Naruto the Movie, Naruto grew again to be one of the tallest of his graduating class, cut his hair short, and wore a black elastic forehead protector. Over his pants and sandals, he wears a black uniform jacket with an orange zipper and buttons on the waist and sleeves, which can be folded up at times. He has a red armband with an Uzumaki crest on his left arm. After becoming Hokage, Naruto dons a garment similar to his father's: a white cape that has a red flame pattern around the hem, is held together by a red rope, and has the kanji for "Seventh Hokage" (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage) written vertically down the back. Underneath this, he wears an orange sweatshirt with black stripes (reverse in the manga version of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations), black pants and sandals. He occasionally wears the traditional Hokage headpiece, but has stopped wearing a forehead protector.</p>

            <p>Originally, Naruto was a rather inept ninja, failing to graduate from the Academy three times. Through sheer determination and training however, his skills rapidly improved to defeat strong genin like Neji Hyūga, Gaara, and Kabuto Yakushi, earning acknowledgement from all the Sannin for his potential. Under various tutelage, Naruto was able to defeat various members of Akatsuki, ultimately earning praise from Konohagakure as a Hokage-material hero. Naruto's personally defeated various reincarnated Kage and jinchūriki during the Fourth Shinobi World War, with many believing he was the central key to winning the battle. By adulthood, his prowess made him the Seventh Hokage, regarded as the strongest shinobi in history and having command of overwhelming jutsu. With the combined might of Sasuke, noted as his only rival as a shinobi, they are said to be able to destroy a continent. Together, they overpowered Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki who absorbed Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki, and pushed Jigen's body to its limit. Overall, he could compete against if not defeat world-threatening opponents, such as Madara Uchiha, Kaguya, Toneri Ōtsutsuki, and while fighting at his absolute peak overwhelm Isshiki Ōtsutsuki.</p>
            <p><strong>Chakra and Physical Prowess</strong>As an Uzumaki and a reincarnation of Asura Ōtsutsuki, Naruto has massive reserves of strong chakra, at least four times greater than Kakashi's, and described by Karin as "bright and warm." His initial poor control of it was offset by his sheer reserves, which were large enough to endure three and a half days of constant battle against several powerful opponents. Only by the end of his battle against Sasuke did he show exhaustion, and even then could still fight to a standstill and eventual victory. Naruto's control improved greatly over time; able to transfer his chakra to others, and perform one-handed hand seals. Naruto's powerful life-force grants him an extreme longevity, healing power, stamina, and vitality; this allowed him to survive the extraction of a tailed beast, though he required aid from Sakura to stay alive. Naruto also learned how to counter genjutsu from Jiraiya, but is limited. In adulthood, Naruto's chakra is powerful enough to intimidate Kawaki into submission and destroy high-level barriers simply by releasing a burst of it. He could repel Shikamaru's Shadow Imitation Technique, a feat that no one else could do. His chakra, when he combined it with his son's Vanishing Rasengan, turned it into a gigantic Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan able to kill the empowered Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki who tried to use a copy of the technique to defeat his. His chakra reserves were also so vast that he was able to overload Delta's chakra-absorbing eye with a continuous Rasengan-assault and still primed to defeat her.</p>
            <p><strong>Fighting Style</strong> While naturally a short-range fighter, Naruto originally was inept at taijutsu, requiring unpredictable attacks to surprise combat experts like Kiba Inuzuka and Neji. He often utilised shadow clones in large if not massive numbers to simply overwhelm his foes. Although these tactics resumed later, Naruto becomes much more adept at taijutsu due to Jiraiya's training. After Fukasaku's tutelage, he could fend off a pair of expert kenjutsu users. Two years after the war, Naruto's taijutsu prowess could best dozens of opponents without shadow clones or enhancements. As Hokage, his taijutsu could pressure Momoshiki after he had absorbed Kinshiki. Naruto could even hold off Delta despite her extreme body modifications, ultimately controlling the pace of the battle to tire her out and gradually overwhelm her to win despite being in the defensive. His speed had also increased to the point where he could effortlessly catch up with Kawaki after he tried to escape. Likewise, in the anime, he is proven very resilient, able to take a point-blank blast from Kawaki's modifications unfazed.</p>
            <p><strong>Six Paths Sage Mode</strong> With the power given to him by Hagoromo, Naruto gained access to the Six Paths Sage Mode (六道仙人モード, Rikudō Sennin Mōdo). In this mode, his pupils take on a cross-like shape — without manifesting the orange pigmentation around his eyes present in Sage Mode. Going further, Naruto donned a new Nine-Tails Chakra Mode cloak, which he could access instantly and maintain much longer than his standard Sage Mode. Naruto's physical attributes and techniques are further augmented, to the point where he could dodge attacks that moved at the speed of light and deflect Truth-Seeking Balls. It also empowers his sensory abilities to the highest possible level, which allowed him to sense the invisible shadows of Limbo. Naruto also retained use of his Tailed Beast Mode avatar of Kurama, which rivalled Sasuke's Rinnegan-empowered Complete Body — Susanoo in size and power. Using three shadow clones, he could create and combine three Kurama avatars into a single construct with three faces and six arms, which is largely reminiscent of Asura's Six Paths: Kunitsukami. This state allowed Naruto to infuse two massive Rasenshuriken with natural energy.
                <ul><strong>Techniques</strong>
                    <li><strong>Naruto Region Combo</strong>The Naruto Region Combo is a taijutsu attack used by Naruto Uzumaki in his Six Paths Sage Mode, Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and while using the Six Paths Senjutsu and is the strongest taijutsu in his arsenal. After using his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, Naruto creates an army of clones to assault his opponent, overwhelming them by attacking on all sides while yelling "U-ZU-MA-KI". The rest of the clones then follow up with a direct attack to finish the combo.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sage Art: Lava Release Rasenshuriken</strong>A powerful technique whereby Naruto, after accessing Son Gokū's power, creates a Rasenshuriken with a lava-infused nucleus, the heat of which causes the blades themselves to emit steam. The technique is strong enough to destroy a target's legs, and when expanded, it was powerful enough to bisect the Ten-Tails' tree form completely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan</strong>A technique that's available to Naruto after inheriting the Sage of the Six Paths' powers. By combining his Rasengan with Shukaku's Magnet Release to reinforce its suction power, he creates a Rasengan with the beast's cursed seal markings. He then smashes the sphere into his opponent in the same manner as a normal Rasengan. Upon being struck with this technique, the markings quickly spread across the target's body and immobilises them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Six Paths: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken</strong>While in his Six Paths Sage Mode, using the Six Paths Senjutsu and fully transformed into Kurama, Naruto creates two shadow clones of the entire chakra construct. The shadow clones merge with the original, creating a three-faced, six-armed construct. In its right arms, it creates a Six Paths Big Ball Rasenshuriken (六道大玉螺旋手裏剣, Rikudō Ōdama Rasenshuriken),[1] and in its left arms, it creates a Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken, both infused with natural energy. It is strong enough to counter Sasuke Uchiha's strongest offensive technique.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken</strong>With help from Kurama, Naruto converts his Truth-Seeking Ball into a Tailed Beast Ball, and adds wind-natured chakra to create the shuriken-like blades around it before hurling it at the target. The resulting explosion dwarfs that of a regular Tailed Beast Ball and can destroy multiple planetoid-like objects in one blast.</li>

            <header>Creation and Conception</header>
            <p>When creating Naruto, Masashi Kishimoto incorporated into the character a number of traits he felt made an ideal hero: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and many of the attributes possessed by Son Gokū from the Dragon Ball franchise. He also made sure to keep Naruto "simple and stupid," since he does not like smart characters. Naruto himself is not modeled after anyone in particular, being conceived as childlike, with something of a dark side as a result of his harsh past. Despite this, he is always positive, making him unique in Kishimoto's eyes.</p>
            <p>Naruto's wardrobe is based on clothing Kishimoto wore when he was younger; according to Kishimoto, using a pre-existing design would not have made Naruto unique, whereas something original would have made him stand out too much. The orange colouring of his costume is used to make Naruto "pop," with blues often being used to complement the orange. Because Naruto is associated with spirals, swirl patterns are incorporated into his costume. Initial illustrations of Naruto had him wearing boots, but Kishimoto substituted these for sandals, because he likes drawing toes. The goggles that Naruto used to wear were also replaced with a forehead protector, because the goggles themselves were too time-consuming to draw. Kishimoto said that he felt glad that his character had blond hair and blue eyes. The editor of Shōnen Jump in the United States added that Kishimoto implied that the traits may have led the character to appeal to a Western audience. Kishimoto said that he most identifies with Naruto out of all of the Naruto characters (in an interview with the U.S. Shōnen Jump, Kishimoto stated that his childhood was like that of Naruto's years while he was enrolled in the Academy).</p>
            <p>In the Japanese versions of Naruto, Naruto often ends his sentences with the addendum "-ttebayo" (which gives a similar effect to ending a sentence with "you know?"). Kishimoto wanted to give Naruto a childlike catchphrase, and "dattebayo" came to mind. It complemented Naruto's character, and served as a verbal tic that showed him to be something of a brat. Throughout the beginning of the English anime, the dub replaced "dattebayo" and "-ttebayo" with the phrase "believe it!" to mirror the effect, as well as to match the character's lip movements.</p>
